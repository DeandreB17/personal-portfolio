	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p> I grew up in a small town in South Carolina called "Lake City". This town is a small diverse community with about 4,000 people approximately. I graduated at Lake City High and I attended Lake City College Prep when I was younger. I am the youngest out of all my brothers and sisters. Also, while growing up I played sports and was on the band. Always was good with gadgets.</p>
	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<p> I played plenty sports in school including soccer, basketball and band these we're my outside activites. Also, me and my friends running around the neigborhood and city. I began to meet new friends and places as I joined these activities. One of my strongest lessons is that one person and can't not do it all by their self. </p>
	<h4>Early Life</h4>
	<p>I began learning early in my life and always wanted a challenge. I was once told in my life that "the lowest paid person could end up being the highest paid, vice versa." This quote stuck with me in my life and made me grind.</p>
	<h5>Interesting Facts</h5>
	<p>	Growing up and coming from the South, fashion is a big part of the culture. I began falling in love with clothing at at a early age and later wanted to customize and make my own clothes for others.</p>
